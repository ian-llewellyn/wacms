WebApps Content Management System
=================================
Developed by: Ian Llewellyn

I wrote the WebApps CMS somewhere around 2010 for the Trim Canoe Club in Meath,
Ireland. Thinking that I might do more sites, I designed it in a way that would
make it easy for me to reuse the code elsewhere. I never did.

I'm making it available now because the CMS is now offline on that site, and my
ego has requested that I keep a copy of it somewhere safe..

If you decide to reuse the code, you'll need to:
* setup a database using the wacms.sql script
* enter the database details into logic/db_mysql.php
* set an admin password in app_start.php
* probably fix a few random minor issues

If you use it, let me know.

Ian
